Challenge #1
3 Tier Environment
Project Name: Project-3-tier

AWS Resources used: 
1. AWS VPC
2. AWS Compute services ( EC2, Security group, Loadbalancers)
3. AWS RDS

All  the three tier helps in keeping the flow of the application going.

Step 1: Settingup VPC, Subnets, Internet gateway and NAT gateway
A VPC is created with 6 subnets and 5 routetables. In total i have choosen 2 availability zones and 2 public subnets and 4 private subnets.

VPC Name: project-3-tier-vpc
Subnets: Public: project-3-tier-subnet-public1-us-east-1a
                 project-3-tier-subnet-public2-us-east-1b
        Private: project-3-tier-subnet-private1-us-east-1a
                 project-3-tier-subnet-private2-us-east-1b
                 project-3-tier-subnet-private3-us-east-1a
                 project-3-tier-subnet-private4-us-east-1b
Internet Gateway: project-3-tier-igw



Step 2: Creation of EC2 using launch templates and Creation of Auto Scaling Groups.

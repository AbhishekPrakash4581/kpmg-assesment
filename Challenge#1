Challenge #1
3 Tier Environment
Project Name: Project-3-tier

AWS Resources used: 
1. AWS VPC
2. AWS Compute services ( EC2, Security group, Loadbalancers)
3. AWS RDS

All  the three tier helps in keeping the flow of the application going.

Step 1: Settingup VPC, Subnets, Internet gateway and NAT gateway

A VPC is created with 6 subnets and 5 routetables. In total i have choosen 2 availability zones and 2 public subnets and 4 private subnets. 
There is one NAT gateway per availability zone.
VPC Name: project-3-tier-vpc
Subnets: Public: project-3-tier-subnet-public1-us-east-1a
                 project-3-tier-subnet-public2-us-east-1b
        Private: project-3-tier-subnet-private1-us-east-1a
                 project-3-tier-subnet-private2-us-east-1b
                 project-3-tier-subnet-private3-us-east-1a
                 project-3-tier-subnet-private4-us-east-1b
Internet Gateway: project-3-tier-igw


Step 2: Creation of EC2 using launch templates and Creation of Auto Scaling Groups.

A Total of 2 security groups have been created. 
Project-3-tier-securitygroup1
Project-3-tier-securitygroup2

Post security group creation , EC2 instances have been created with the help of Launch templates by using of the security groups which was created before.
Two Launch templates have been created One for Web and one for Application:
Launch template Name : 
1. Project-3tier-launch
2. Project-3tier-application

Autoscaling group has been created to both Public subnets and Private subnets
1. Project-3tier-web-autoscaling ( Autoscaling group for Public subnet)
2. Project-3tier-application-autoscaling ( Autoscaling group for Private subnet) 

Instance ID'S: 
1. i-0b905cf4724678f13
2. i-0097df4cf56b1be59 : Public IPV4: 3.91.104.217
3. i-0a7eb33165147ac44 : Public IPV4: 54.209.190.234
4. i-0e793eee0e09d5c1f

Step 3: Creating Database

A new Database subnet group has been created
DB Subnet group name: project-3tier-db-subnetgroup

A standard Mysql DB has been created with version '8.0.30'. And in Settings section, a master password is created and saved.

Conclusion: Test the EC2's created
For Testing access the IPV4 of Public Instances: '3.91.104.217' and '54.209.190.234'
